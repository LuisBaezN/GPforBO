# GPforBO

Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to find a maximum or minimum global in a black box process through acquisition functions (AF). In this repo a genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented to find the best AF. The GA is tested with synthetic data in a problem with one dimension.

## Attention

The full documentation and instructions to run this algorithm will be available soon.
